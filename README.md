# Data-Analyser
Developed a tool for Prediction Modelling, Data analysis. There exist already high level frameworks Like SPSS, R. But main user group of these tools was those people, who are not very efficient to Statistical concepts, Machine-learning techniques, Regression Analysis. This tool helps to use apply different statistical aspects without programming experience.

This is a predictive modeling application that will automatically generate a predictive model algorithm based on an imported database, a set of business rules to evaluate each field of the database, and the final model based on the fields that meet the business rules criteria.


This is written in Python programming language. Where possible, integrate Sklearn, pandas  such that instead of writing code from scratch, it may be possible do all operations in sophisticated GUI.  For example, packages have been written to generate CART and Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB) models.
